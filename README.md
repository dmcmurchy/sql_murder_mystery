# [SQL Murder Mystery by Knight Lab](https://mystery.knightlab.com/)

A walkthrough of my solution to the SQL Murder Mystery using [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) + [SQLITE](https://sqlite.org/) database in a Jupyter Notebook using the [magic_duckdb](https://github.com/iqmo-org/magic_duckdb) cell and line magics.

### Credits
The SQL Murder Mystery was created by Joon Park and Cathy He while they were Knight Lab fellows. See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries) for more information.
